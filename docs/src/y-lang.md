# The Y Programming Language

_by H1ghBre4k3r._

This text is meant as a basic guide to the Y Programming Language. I want to introduce you to the foundations and concepts of the language, as well as give you some orientation on what to build with it.

If you happen to find and issues within this documentation, feel free to open an issue in the [official repository](https://github.com/H1ghBre4k3r/y-lang/issues).
